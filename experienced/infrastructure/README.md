# DML Coding Challenge // Infrastructure

Here we have provided an Elastic Search instance powered by Docker. If you do not have Docker installed, what is wrong with you?

Kidding of course, check out [this guide](https://google.com) on getting started.

## Usage

- `docker compose up`

This will start an Elastic instance at `http://localhost:9200`.
