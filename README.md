## Overview

Wanting to put my personal spin on this project, and being a Type 1 diabetic myself, I decided to make a blood glucose log for my DML challange _(timeboxing myself to ~8 hours of work)_.

**Diabetes Management Log** ( _or (DML)_ ) is a simple single page application where diabetics can track their blood sugar levels.
Users can log a new value with specialized comments for each entry, or remove an existing entry at any time.

**Additional features** include the option to sort by data or glucose value, a detailed entry view, and an overall average glucose tracker.
