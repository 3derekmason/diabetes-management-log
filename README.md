# DML Coding Challenge 

Welcome to the coding challenge for Distributed Media Lab!

## Highlights

- This may be completed in JavaScript or TypeScript. We prefer TS, but there will be **no penalty** for using JS.
- There are no tricks, or traps in this challenge. We are not interested in wasting your time with any gimmicks.
- You may use any library, database, and styling you want. Just be ready to back up your decision if asked.
- A starter template has been provided for both the [API](./api/README.md) and the [UI](./ui/README.md). You are not required to use these, they are just there for your convenience.

## How You Will Be Assessed

Each section has their own acceptance criteria. There are also some bonus checkboxes thrown in where applicable. There is no penalty for skipping the bonus.

## Getting started

You will need to run both the UI and the API separately. They each have their own instructions as to how to get started.

## Submitting

When you are ready to submit, either send us a link to the repository you have pushed your code to, or email us a zip file. Whatever is easier for you.

We have provided a way to quickly zip your submission, simply run `npm run zip` from the `zip/` directory to spit out a zipped submission.
